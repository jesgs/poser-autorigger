# Poser Autorigger for Blender

**Under development—Use at your own risk**

An autorigger for Poser characters imported as FBX files.

This auto-rigging tool is intended for figures that were exported from Poser as FBX files—which already have an existing base armature. This tool takes that existing armature and automates the setup of IK/FK chains, bone collections, and bone widgets.

This tool also adds a deformer bone to the spine chain called `LowerAbdomen` in order to complete the imported spine chain from Poser. However, it does not create a weight-group. This weight-group will need to be created manually and blended with the hip and abdomen weight-groups. This feature may be removed or moved behind an option flag.

## Motivation

The motivation for creating this tool was to automate a number of tasks I do to a figure that I've imported from Poser. It also standardizes my workflow so I'm not forgetting my naming conventions or collection sets between when working on different figures.

## **Workflow Summary**

1. User imports their FBX Poser character to Blender.
2. Runs auto-rigger script/addon.
3. Addon detects the armature, generates required IK/FK chains, creates controls, and assigns custom shapes.
4. Rig is ready for animation with standard Blender controls.

## TODOs

- [x] Move mesh correction code to [Poser Tools](https://github.com/jesgs/poser-tools)
- [ ] **FEATURE**: Add option for Rig UI panel but still provide support for [Bone Manager](https://fin.gumroad.com/l/STdb) and [Rig UI](https://superhivemarket.com/products/rig-ui)
- [ ] Test against other Poser figures (Daz3d Millennium 4 figures, La Femme and Le Homme, AnimeDoll, etc.)
- [ ] Bring code in line with [Blender guidelines](https://developer.blender.org/docs/features/extensions/moderation/guidelines/)
- [ ] Consider merging [Poser Tools](https://github.com/jesgs/poser-tools) with this add-on.
- [ ] **FEATURE**: Remove process for creating root bone from the useless Body bone.
- [ ] **FEATURE**: Move process for creating lower abdomen bone to an option
- [ ] **FEATURE**: Add option for creating pelvis bones
- [ ] **FEATURE**: Add base face rig, which will need to be adjusted by the user to fit the character.
  - [ ] Automate creation of inner mouth rig.
    - [ ] Generate deformer, MCH and control bones for upper and lower teeth.
    - [ ] Generate deformer, MCH and control bones for jaw.
  - [ ] Automate creation of tongue rig
    - [ ] IK/FK switching
    - [ ] Spline IK chain

## Ideas
Below are some ideas that could be handled by user before the control rig is generated. Rig generation process would automatically detect these bones and add controls as needed. 
The process to create the `LowerAbdomen` bone and reposition the `Body` bone and rename it `root` could also be optionally left to the user.
- [ ] Add option to modify hip/buttock bones into a full pelvis setup. This process should run before bones are renamed, similar to how LowerAbdomen is created.
  - `Left_Buttock` and `Right_Buttock` are renamed to `Left_Hip` and `Right_Hip`. The tail of each bone should be aligned to their respective heads
  - Create `Left_Pelvis` and parent it to the main `Hip` bone. Position the head of each bone to align with the head of the `Hip` bone
    - Align x-axis of the tail of `Left_Pelvis` with the head of `Left_Hip` (`Left_Hip` head.x - ~0.0096)
    - Align y-axis of the tail of `Left_Pelvis` with the head of `Left_Hip` (`Left_Hip` head.y + ~-0.0474)
    - Align z-axis of the tail of `Left_Pelvis` with the head of `Left_Hip` (`Left_Hip` head.z + ~0.052)
  - Create `Left_Buttock` and parent it to `Left_Pelvis`. Head of `Left_Buttock` should be aligned with tail of `Left_Pelvis`. Position tail of `Left_Buttock`:
    - `Left_Buttock` tail.x = `Left_Pelvis` head.x - 0.035
    - `Left_Buttock` tail.y = `Left_Pelvis` head.y + -0.16
    - `Left_Buttock` tail.z = `Left_Pelvix` head.z - 0.0603
- [ ] Add option to create breast/pectoral deforming bones.

## Base Feature Set for Poser FBX Auto-Rigger in Blender

### 1. IK/FK Chain Creation
- **Limbs (Arms & Legs):**
  - [x] Detect existing limb bones (shoulder, upper arm, forearm, hand, thigh, shin, foot).
  - [x] Generate IK chains for arms and legs.
  - [x] Generate FK chains for arms and legs.
  
- **Fingers:**
  - [x] Detect finger bones.
  - [x] Create FK controls for each finger.
  - [x] Add IK controls for each finger, including thumb.

- **Spine:**
  - [x] Detect spine bones.
  - [x] Create FK controls along the spine.
  - [x] Create IK controls along the spine.
  - [ ] Change deformer bones to full bendy-bones.

### 2. Foot Roll Control
- **Foot Rig Features:**
  - [x] Add foot roll controller.
  - [ ] Setup constraints for toe bend, heel lift, ball roll, etc.
  - [ ] Automatic foot banking (side-to-side roll).

### 3. Constraints Setup
- **Rig Constraints:**
  - [x] Add necessary constraints for all IK and FK chains.
  - [x] Ensure pole targets are generated and positioned correctly for knees/elbows.
  - [x] Setup drivers or custom properties for easy switching and control.
  - [ ] Limit Rotation constraints for bones that need them

### 4. Control Custom-Shapes
- **Custom Bone Shapes:**
  - [x] Assign custom shapes to each main control (IK handles, FK controls, foot roll, pole targets).

### 5. User Interface (Optional, but recommended for usability)
- **Rig UI Panel:**
  - [ ] Add a custom sidebar panel in Blender for rig controls (IK/FK switch, foot roll parameters, etc.).
  - [ ] Buttons for common actions (zero pose, snap FK to IK, etc.).
  - [ ] Panel to control figure's "non-driven" shapekeys.

### 6. Error Checking and Reporting
- **Validation:**
  - [ ] Check for missing bones or naming conventions (warn if not standard).
  - [ ] Warn if FBX armature isn’t compatible (missing limbs, etc.).
