Ideas for additional finger/hand controls.

### 1. **Finger Curl Controls**
- Create a single control that curls all fingers simultaneously (useful for gripping or fist poses).
- Optionally, add per-finger curl sliders.

### 2. **Individual Finger Spread Controls**
- Controls for spreading fingers apart or bringing them together (e.g., “fan” or “splay”).

### 3. **Fist Pose/Relax Pose Presets**
- Quick pose buttons or sliders for common hand shapes (fist, relaxed, pointing, open palm).

### 4. **Finger Tip IK**
- IK handles at each fingertip for fine control, especially useful for interacting with objects.
- Allows fingers to "plant" on surfaces, like a table or keyboard.

### 5. **Palm/Hand Roll**
- Control to roll the entire palm side-to-side, simulating wrist and metacarpal movement.

### 6. **Stretch/Squash Controls**
- Ability to stretch or squash fingers for cartoon or stylized animation.

### 7. **Automatic Knuckle and Thumb Adjustments**
- Thumb controls for opposition and abduction.
- Automated secondary motion (e.g., knuckle bending when the finger curls).

### 8. **Finger Pose Copy/Paste**
- Tools to copy a pose from one hand and paste to another (great for symmetrical animation).

### 9. **Finger Dynamics (Physics-based)**
- Optional: physics-driven secondary motion for fingers (less common, but useful for stylized rigs).

### 10. **Hand Follow/Local Space Switching**
- Switch controls between following the arm (parented to wrist) or staying in global/world space.

### 11. **Gesture Library Support**
- Store and recall custom hand gestures for quick reuse.
